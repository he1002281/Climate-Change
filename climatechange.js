This could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change is currently occurring throughout the world as a result of global warming. Global warming is an increase in the overall temperature of the planet due to the burning of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Burning these materials releases certain gases into the atmosphere of the Earth. These gases trap the heat from the rays of the Sun inside the atmosphere, causing the average temperature of the Earth to rise. </p><p> The effects of climate change make average temperatures and weather patterns more unpredictable. This affects everyone no matter their location for example an arid region this may mean higher than average temperatures and more severe or prolonged droughts. While In a temperate region, it may mean that there is a lot of rain one year, and then very little rain the next year. </p><p> Climate change has also been connected with other damaging weather events such as more frequent and more intense hurricanes, floods, downpours, and winter storms. </p><p> In polar regions, the warming global temperatures associated with climate change have meant ice sheets and glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate from season to season. This contributes to sea levels rising in different regions of the planet. Together with expanding ocean waters due to rising temperatures, the resulting rise in sea level has begun to damage coastlines as a result of increased flooding and erosion. </p><p> In our website we hope to bring awareness of climate change and its effects on all regions including our own homes, rainforests and oceans. We will also give tips on how you can reduce your carbon footprint and help prevent climate change from worsening. </p>';

  document.getElementById("home").innerHTML = '<h2>Causes</h2><h2>The Greenhouse Gas Effect</h2><p>The main cause of climate change is the rise in greenhouse gases in our atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The greenhouse gas effect, as it is referred to, is the heating of the earth caused by certain gases in our atmosphere that trap sunlight and heat in the atmosphere and reflect it in all directions. The most common of these gases are Water vapor (H2O), Methane (CH4), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O).<br><iframe width=50% height=360 src="https://youtube.com/embed/K9kga9c0u2I"></iframe></p><h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2><p><img src="https://climate.nasa.gov/system/content_pages/main_images/1_greenhouse_effect_rev_5-22-19.gif" width=576 height=324 style="float:right;">Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas and acts as an important "feedback" gas, meaning it is not permanently in the atmosphere and changes with climate and temperature. For example, more condensation and precipitation occurs as the temperature rises.<br>Carbon dioxide is a minor but important part of atmosphere, released by natural processes such as volcano eruptions and respiration but also by human activities such as deforestation. Burning fossil fuels combines oxygen and carbon to create carbon dioxide and has been a large cause of its increased concentration in the atmosphere. Its concentration in the atmosphere has increased by a third since the beginning of the industrial revolution.<br><img src="https://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/249_Causes-greenhouse-gas-molecules-cropped-more-55.jpg" width=419.5 height=268.5 style="float:left;">Methane is less abundant but also more active than carbon dioxide. Comes from decomposition of waste and manure management associated with livestock.<br>Nitrous Oxide is a powerful greenhouse gas. It is produced by use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.<br>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are man-made compounds that can act as greenhouse gases. After they were discovered to have the ability to destroy the ozone layer, they became largely regulated in production and release.<br></p><h2>How do we know we are causing it?</h2><p><img src="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sites/default/files/blog-humancause-1.png" width=630.75 height=444.75 style="float:left;">Carbon emissions have increased by over 400% since 1950 and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached 400 parts per million (compared with 228 ppm at the beginning of the industrial revolution). But how do we know that this is what is causing climate change? Could it be caused by changes in the Sun rather than changes on Earth? Scientists have known since the early 1800s that greenhouse gases cause climate change. Additionally, satellites have shown a slight decrease in the total energy output of the sun since 1970 but the temperature has only risen. Furthermore, the upper atmosphere is cooling as lower atmosphere is heating. If this phenomenon was due to the sun, the whole atmosphere would be heating together.  Scientists have discovered that the reason for the discrepancy between trends in the upper and lower atmosphere is due to the heat getting trapped in the lower atmosphere and not making it to the upper atmosphere.<img src="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sites/default/files/blog-humancause-2.png" width=665 height=370 style="float:right;"> Finally, climate models that include solar irradiance cannot get reproducible results to explain the rise in temperature over the last few decades without including the rise in greenhouse gases. Thus, it is clear that is not changes in the Sun causing climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report in which 1300 scientific experts determined that there is more than a 95% chance that human activity has warmed the planet over the last 50 years. They also concluded that there is a more than 95% chance that human produced greenhouse gases have caused much of the increase in temperature over the past 50 years. It is more than likely that human activity and the emission of greenhouse gases has caused climate change.<br></p><h2>What is your carbon footprint?</p><form id="carbon"> Do you live in a house or an apartment?<br><input type="radio" name="home" value="house"> House<br><input type="radio" name="home" value="apartment"> Apartment<br>Do you have air conditioning? <br><input type="radio" name="air" value="yes"> Yes<br><input type="radio" name="air" value="no"> No<br>How many people live in your household? <br><input type="text" name="people"><br>How many miles do you drive per year?<br><input type="text" name="drive"><br>How many miles do you travel by bus each week?<br><input type="text" name="bus"><br>How many miles do you travel by train each week?<br><input type="text" name="train"><br>How many flights do you take a year?<br><input type="text" name="flight"><br><button type="button" onclick="calculate()">Submit</button></form><p id="hi" style="color:white;"></p>';

Not only does a rise of temperature mean an increase in sea level, but it also means a greater risk of losing key ecosystems. For example, one of the most important species in the ocean, is coral. Coral not only provides shelter and food for different types of fish, but it also protects coastlines from natural disasters. However with an increase in temperature, the effect that it has on coral is deadly. Rising temperatures cause coral bleaching and coral bleaching is when the coral emits saved algae from its cells into the ocean, causing it to lose pigment. Although that does not mean that they are dead, but they are at a greater risk for mortality. </p><p><iframe width="660" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZ5p-If5_9o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style ="float:right"></iframe>Not only does global warming cause a loss of an important ecosystem, but it also increases the risk of collateral damage for both the ocean and land. As aforementioned, rising sea levels increases the chance of flooding and natural disasters, but it also strengthens the force of storms. With water temperatures warm, it is easier for water to turn into vapor and increase the strength of storms such as hurricanes and typhoons. Similarly with rising temperatures in the ocean, it becomes a great place for bacteria to live. Warm, dark, with water to thrive off of, the strength of bacteria is increasing and causing more frequent diseases in the ocean, further harming the ecosystem.<br><h2>Play Ocean Escapade</h2><center><iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/323361348/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="900" height="602" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>'

Because of this, more arid areas are having higher spring and summer temps, less snowfall, early snowmelt, longer dry seasons and therefore, more droughts and forest fires. Additionally, hotter temperatures lead to more prolonged and intense forest fires. Wildfires in the western U.S. have been increasing in frequency and duration since the mid-1980s. A report released by the Trump administration weeks after deadliest wildfire in CA history says continued release of greenhouse gases will make fires more frequent. Because of the release of greenhouse gases, there is more potential for very large fires that burn 12400+ acres. A recent study estimated that half as much forest area would have been burned between the years 1984 and 2015 if it were not for global warming and over the past 15-20 years the number of forests rebound after wildfire has declined significantly.</p><p>Wildfires cost the U.S. in both money and lives. The economic costs of wildfire estimated to be hundreds of millions of dollars in US property damage a year. Furthermore, fire-suppression cost 1 million+ dollars a year between 2000-2017 including 2 million+ dollars 2015 and 3 million+ dollars in 2017. In addition to the fatality and cost of wildfires themselves, they have the potential to increase air pollution leading to more lung diseased and breathing difficulty for people living in surrounding areas. Making a bad situation worse, loss of vegetation and damaged soil can flash floods in lower areas when it rains causing more loss of life and property damage.<img src=https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2018/11/26/national-climate-assessment-fires/8dae3566c21240d0b274e4e0a153067a160034db/maps-Artboard-xl.jpg style="width:100%"><div id="forest">1971-2000</div><div id="fire">2041-2070</div><div id="fires">Very large fires per years</div><div id="frequent">More frequent</div></p><h2>Hurricanes</h2><p><img src="https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/2016/08/gw-impacts-hurricane-air-flow-diagram.jpg?itok=85oV62An" width=630 height=288.75 style="float:right;"> There is evidence that the rising temperatures caused by climate change are leading to a more humid atmosphere, which provides fuel for hurricanes. Additionally, because of climate change, there is less low temp surface water that often naturally break up hurricanes. While there is little evidence of an increase in frequency of hurricanes, there is evidence that hurricanes have been becoming increasingly intense in the past 30 years. According to a peer-reviewed study, the number of hurricanes that reached categories 4 and 5 has significantly increased in the last 15 year period when compared with the one before it. Furthermore, the number of category 4 &5 storms is expected to double by the end of the century in frequency, the western Atlantic seeing the largest increase. </p><h2>Tornadoes</h2><p><img src="https://insideclimatenews.org/sites/default/files/styles/icn_full_wrap_wide/public/article_images/tornado-kansas-900_jason-weingart-barcroft-images-barcroft-media-via-getty.jpg?itok=XVMq77Xd" width=250 height=200 style="float:left;">While evidence that climate change creating more moisture and turbulent energy in the atmosphere correlates to increasingly large outbreaks of tornadoes, there is very little evidence that climate change plays a worsening tornadoes. Tornadoes are hard to study because we did not have comprehensive records of them until recently and they are complex, dynamic, short-lived, small and vary greatly from year to year. The U.S. has been having more tornado activity and outbreaks than it has in decades before but it is unclear whether this is linked with climate change.</p><h2>What will happen where you live?</h2><p><form id="natural">Where do you live?<br><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDLVrSldPb8/maxresdefault.jpg" width=400 height=240><br><input type="radio" name="location" value="Northeast">Northeast<input type="radio" name="location" value="Midwest">Midwest<input type="radio" name="location" value="Southeast">Southeast<input type="radio" name="location" value="Southwest">Southwest<input type="radio" name="location" value="West">West</form><button type="button" onclick="submit()" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Submit</button><div id="change" style="font-size:30px;color:white;"></div></p>';

function solutions(){
  document.getElementById("home").innerHTML = '<h2>What you can do to help!</h2><p id="text"><h2> Food: </h2> <p> 1. Eat low on the food chain. This means eating mostly fruits, veggies, grains, and beans. Livestock, meat and dairy is responsible for 14.5 percent of manmade global greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from feed production and processing and the methane (25 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere over 100 years) that beef and sheep belch out. Every day that you do not eat meat or dairy, you can reduce your carbon footprint by 8 pounds-that is 2,920 pounds a year. You can start by joining Meatless Mondays. </p><p> 2. Choose organic and local foods that are in season. Transporting food from far away, whether by truck, ship, rail or plane, uses fossil fuels for fuel and for cooling to keep food in transit from spoiling.</p><p> 3. Buy food in bulk when possible using your own reusable container. </p><p> 4. Reduce your food waste by planning meals ahead of time, freezing the excess and reusing leftovers. </p><p> 5. Compost your food waste if possible. </p><h2> Clothing: </h2> <p> 6. Do not buy fast fashion. Trendy, cheap items that go out of style quickly get dumped in landfills where they produce methane as they decompose. Currently, the average American discards about 80 pounds of clothing each year, 85 percent of which ends up in landfills. In addition, most fast fashion comes from China and Bangladesh, so shipping it to the U.S. requires the use of fossil fuels. Instead, buy quality clothing that will last. </p><p> 7. Even better, buy vintage or recycled clothing at consignment shops. </p><p> 8. Wash your clothing in cold water. The enzymes in cold water detergents are designed to clean better in cold water. Doing two loads of laundry weekly in cold water instead of hot or warm water can save up to 500 pounds of carbon dioxide each year. </p><h2> Shopping: </h2><p> 9. Buy less stuff! And buy used or recycled items whenever possible. </p><p> 10. Bring your own reusable bag when you shop. </p><p> 11. Try to avoid items with excess packaging. </p><p> 12. If you are in the market for a new computer, choose a laptop instead of a desktop. Laptops require less energy to charge and operate than desktops.</p><p> 13. If shopping for appliances, lighting, office equipment or electronics, look for Energy Star products, which are certified to be more energy efficient.</p><p> 14. Support and buy from companies that are environmentally responsible and sustainable.</p><h2> Home:</h2> <p> 15. Do an energy audit of your home. This will show how you use or waste energy and help identify ways to be more energy efficient.</p><p> 16. Change incandescent light bulbs (which waste 90 percent of their energy as heat) to light emitting diodes (LEDs). Though LEDs cost more, they use a quarter of the energy and last up to 25 times longer. They are also preferable to compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) bulbs, which emit 80 percent of their energy as heat and contain mercury.</p><p> 17. Switch lights off when you leave the room and unplug your electronic devices when they are not in use.</p><p> 18. Turn your water heater down to 120 degrees fahrenheit. This can save about 550 pounds of CO2 a year.</p><p> 19. Installing a low-flow showerhead to reduce hot water use can save 350 pounds of CO2. Taking shorter showers helps, too.</p><p> 20. Lower your thermostat in winter and raise it in summer. Use less air conditioning in the summer; instead use fans, which require less electricity. And check out these other ways to beat the heat without air conditioning.</p><p> 21. Sign up to get your electricity from clean energy through your local utility or a certified renewable energy provider. Green-e.org can help you find a certified green energy providers.</p><h2> Transportation:</h2> <p> 22. Drive less. Walk, take public transportation, carpool, rideshare or bike to your destination when possible. This not only reduces CO2 emissions, it also lessens traffic congestion and idling of engines that accompanies it.</p><p> 23. If you must drive, avoid unnecessary braking and acceleration. Some studies found that aggressive driving can result in 40 percent more fuel consumption than consistent, calm driving. </p><p> 24. Take care of your car. Keeping your tires properly inflated can increase your fuel efficiency by three percent and ensuring that your car is properly maintained can increase it by four percent. Remove any extra weight from the car. </p><p> 25. When doing errands, try to combine them to reduce your driving. </p><p> 26. Use traffic apps like Waze to help avoid getting stuck in traffic jams. </p><p> 27. On longer trips, turn on the cruise control, which can save gas. </p><p> 28. Use less air conditioning while you drive, even when the weather is hot. </p><p> 29. If you are shopping for a new car, consider purchasing a hybrid or electric vehicle. But do factor in the greenhouse gas emissions from the production of the car as well as its operation. Some electric vehicles are initially responsible for more emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles because of manufacturing impacts, but they make up for it after three years. Waze rates cars based on their mileage, fuel type and emissions from both the production of the car and, if they are EVs, from generating the electricity to run them. </p><h2> Air travel: </h2> <p> 32. Fly nonstop since landings and takeoffs use more fuel and produce more emissions. </p><p> 33. Go economy class. Business class is responsible for almost three times as many emissions as economy because in economy, the carbon emissions of the flight are shared among more passengers; first class can result in nine times more carbon emissions than economy.</p><p>34. If you cannot avoid flying, offset the carbon emissions of your travel.</p><h2>Get politically active</h2><p>35. Finally-and perhaps most importantly since the most effective solutions to climate change require governmental action-vote! Become politically active and let your representatives know you want them to take action to phase out fossil fuels use and decarbonize the country as fast as possible. </p></p></h2><center><p><img src = "https://ecotricity.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ElectricityEmissionsSMall.gif" width ="950"> </center><h3><table><tr><th><strong>oraginization</strong></th><th><strong>what they do</strong></th></tr><tr><td> <a href="https://350.org/"> 350.org </a> </td><td> They try to listen to the communities who are getting hit the hardest, and follow the leadership of those who are on the frontlines of the crisis.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.edf.org/"> Environmental Defense Fund </a></td><td>Rooted in strong science and economics, they work with allies across the political spectrum and partnering with business, turning ideas into lasting change.
